# UD â€” An Urban Dictionary iOS client
![App icon][appicon]

UD is an unofficial [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) website native client for iOS. It is built entirely in SwiftUI and features a native user interface as well as a couple of homescreen widgets. I've built it mainly to practice my SwiftUI skills and to finally start the transition from UIKit in my pet projects.
